# NFTW - The NFT Marketplace

Introducing NFTW - The NFT Marketplace built on top of the Opensea API

### About
The world is witnessing a decentralized revolution with the rapid rise in the adoption of blockchain technologies accross the globe. Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a great way to establish authenticity, ownership and economic value of any digital asset. I've been fascinated by crypto recently and knew I wanted to build something in this space as soon I saw the announcement.

NFTW is built on top of the Opensea API and allows users to browse and search through thousands of NFTs listed on the platform. Additionally, NFTW includes social features like liking and commenting so users can share their thoughts on any asset.
